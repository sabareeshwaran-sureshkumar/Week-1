# Chatbot Implementation using NLP  

## 📌 Overview  
This project is part of the **AICTE Internship** to develop a chatbot using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**. In **Week 1**, the focus was on defining chatbot intents, responses, and setting up a basic framework.  

## 📂 Task Completed (Week 1)  
✅ Defined chatbot intents and responses  
✅ Enhanced response variety for better engagement  
✅ Added a new intent: **Loan Eligibility**  
✅ Streamlined code structure for readability  
✅ Integrated essential libraries: **NLTK, Scikit-Learn, and Streamlit**  

## 🚀 Technologies Used  
- **Python**  
- **NLTK** (Natural Language Toolkit)  
- **Scikit-Learn** (Machine Learning Model)  
- **Streamlit** (Web Interface for Chatbot)  

## 🔧 Installation  
To run the chatbot, install the required dependencies:  
```bash
pip install nltk scikit-learn streamlit
```  

## 🏗️ How to Run  
1. Clone the repository or download the project files.  
2. Run the script using Streamlit:  
   ```bash
   streamlit run chatbot.py
   ```  
3. Interact with the chatbot through the web interface!  

## 📌 Next Steps  
- Implement **training models** for better response accuracy.  
- Enhance **conversation flow** with contextual memory.  
- Deploy the chatbot using a cloud platform.
